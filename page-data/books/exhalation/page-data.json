I normally do not read sci-fi, but I enjoyed all of Ted Chiang's short stories. Each story left me thinking about the common questions of humanity (who are we? are we special in the universe? what makes us human? do we have free will?). The technological elements of the stories were definitely really cool, but it felt like the main focuses of the stories were not the cool parts of technology, but rather the questions that humans have always asked about humanity, and will always continue to ask. </p>\n<p>I also felt like I was reading the short-story equivalent of Black Mirror or Love Sex Robots. I enjoyed the questions that Chiang posed and got me thinking a lot about. </p>\n<p>Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate was my favorite story. While many of the later stories went more in depth exploring different technological or scientific themes and ideas, I liked Merchant the most because it felt the tightest in terms of its storytelling. Of course, I loved the recursive story structure (and how the writing style \"mirrored\" the themes), and I'm always a sucker for frame narratives.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 20, 2020","path":"/books/exhalation","title":"Exhalation","author":"Ted Chiang","posttype":"books","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
