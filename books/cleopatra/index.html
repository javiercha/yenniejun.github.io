<h3>b. 69 BCE, d. 30 BCE, age 39</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“She lost a kingdom once, regained it, nearly lost it again, amassed an empire, lost it all. A goddess as a child, a queen at eighteen, a celebrity soon thereafter, she was an object of speculation and veneration, gossip and legend, even in her own time” (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleopatra ruled Egypt for 22 years as one of the last Ptolemies during the first century BCE. She was a skilled and clever queen who raised armies, managed day-to-day Egyptian affairs, governed her people, and navigated the intricacies of royal politics and diplomacy. She was richer than anyone else in the Mediterranean during her time. She was a fascinating woman and a shrewd politician, opportunistic and canny and charismatic. She had children by two of the most prominent Roman politicians at the time, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Her epithet on coins, “Queen of Kings, whose songs are Kings,” was a very fitting title. And yet, she is remembered for many of the wrong reasons. To this day, she is a fascinating symbol in history and in pop culture of women in power. </p>
<hr>
<h2>The Narrative of Her Story</h2>
<p>Cleopatra is remembered today for many of the wrong reasons. She was a capable sovereign who ruled one of the richest countries in the Mediterranean, a canny politician, and an independent woman. And yet, she is remembered by many for being temptress and seductress. </p>
<p>Part of the reason is because we are limited by the sources we have left documenting her life. Because she lived and died more than 2000 years ago, there are few remaining primary documents documenting what she said and what she thought, so we can only speculate on those fronts. For a woman who spoke so many languages, we have so few of her words left. </p>
<p>Most of her history has been written and overwritten by the men who came after her and had the privilege of writing the winner’s side of history. After her defeat to Augustus, her narrative was entirely taken over by Rome, an empire that did not approve of her because she defied their narrow view of submissive womanhood and because she was their mortal enemy. And so her story is told in the voice of her enemy, and as one can imagine, that voice is not very forgiving or empathetic. </p>
<p>Augustus “magnified Cleopatra to hyperbolic proportions so as to do the same with his victory” and portrayed her as treacherous, bloodthirsty, and power-crazy (6). He downsized her intelligence and attributed her cleverness and influence to magic, luck, and sexual vice. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augustus needed to restore things to its natural order: “men ruled women, and Rome ruled the world” (319)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Roman history and point of view, Cleopatra, the sexual and deceptive woman, “enslaved” both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, thus spelling their doom. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Relevance to Today - Women and Power</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Can anything good be said of a woman who slept with the two most powerful men of her time? Possibly, but not in the age when Rome controlled the narrative. Cleopatra stood at one of the most dangerous intersections in history: that of women and power” (4) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was Cleopatra important? She was one of the few women leaders who held a level of influence, wealth, and power comparable to the male leaders at the top during her time period (i.e. Julius Caesar, Octavian, Mark Antony). She was a capable and clever ruler, diplomat, politician, and leader. She was smart, charismatic, and opportunistic. And she held her power in her own name. She came to power because of her own ambitions, intelligence, and abilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Female ambition, accomplishment, authority, trouble us as they did the Romans” (323) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, like many women in history and women today, she had to deal with double standards. The two men she is most known for sleeping with, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, were both notorious for their numerous affairs and their voracious sexual appetites. And yet, Cleopatra is the one to go down in history as the scheming seductress. Her influence over the two men is often cited as magic and sexual manipulation. By claiming that Cleopatra’s power derived not from her intelligence but from her sexuality, the nuances of her life and of her ambitious, clever mind is reduced to sexual manipulation and scheming. It is a huge insult to her intelligence and independence to attribute everything to her sexuality. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is less threatening to believe her fatally attractive than fatally intelligent” (320)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most men in power, participating in affairs with and seducing women was a common event which often added to their status and power. However, for Cleopatra, engaging in similar behavior resulted in negatively staining her reputation (at least in Rome’s eyes) because such behavior made her deviant and socially disruptive, and consequently, threatening. Cleopatra was a threat because she was a powerful woman, and labeling her as a seductress and as the symbol of wanton sexuality was a way of dismissing her power and influence.</p>
<p>Today, women from all backgrounds and professions from all over the world struggle with similar situations. Women are still very underrepresented in top leadership positions (i.e. Congressional representatives, Fortune 500 CEOs, college presidents) and the workplace is abundant with rumors of women who slept their way around to the top. Women, especially those in fields with a female minority such as in STEM, face sexual discrimination every day. Like Cleopatra, women in the workplace today, especially women in power, face many challenges in the struggle to compete with the men in power and to have their voices heard.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>It is important to remember the historical context in which Cleopatra reigned, lived, loved, and fought in. Many of the things Cleopatra has been criticized for are actions that have to be kept within context of the world she lived in – that of a Ptolemaic Greek queen living in a Hellenistic world in the first century BC. For example, she is vilified for murdering her siblings and marrying her son, but it is important to keep in mind that this was common behavior among sovereigns during this time period around the Mediterranean region. Herod murdered his children. Most of the Ptolemies practiced sibling marriage, which originated as an Egyptian custom, and was justified as a way to minimize claimants to the throne. It was common for sisters to marry brothers, nieces to marry uncles. Sibling rivalry was rampant. For example, Cleopatra had two sisters and two brothers, and all five siblings met violent ends.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Her Accomplishments</h2>
<p>Cleopatra did more to unite the East and the West than anyone since Alexander the Great. In fact, she did more than Alexander, because she managed to ensure several successors to the throne. She was a proficient, reliable, capable, and opportunistic leader. She maintained and sustained a vast, rich, and densely populated empire.</p>
<p>After her death, the immense Egyptian wealth flooded into Rome. Egyptian art and obelisks decorated Rome. Cleopatra was everywhere in Rome even after Rome had taken over Egypt. Cleopatra marked the end of an era (the Ptolemaic Dynasty and with it, the Hellenistic Age) and the beginning of a new one (the Roman Empire). </p>
<hr>
<h2>Her Story</h2>
<p>Cleopatra was born as one of the last daughters of the Ptolemaic Dynasty during the end of the Hellenistic Era, which describes the period of Greek influence in the Mediterranean area following the death of Alexander the Great. As a Ptolemy, Cleopatra was Greek in ancestry rather than Egyptian. </p>
<p>She was groomed and educated to be queen from a young age. There were plenty of strong Ptolemaic and Egyptian female rulers preceding her, and powerful queens were not an anomaly. An exceptional part about Cleopatra’s education was that she learned the Egyptian language. It was common for the Egyptians to learn Greek but it was actually very rare for the Greeks to learn Egyptian. Cleopatra was the first and only Ptolemy to take the time to learn the vernacular language spoken by the over 7 million Egyptian people that the Ptolemies ruled over. </p>
<p>Through her childhood and early womanhood, she experienced a lot of family drama and power struggles vying for throne. This was not unusual in Egyptian politics – it was common for children to betray parents, sisters to murder brothers, and parents to exile children. By the time Caesar came to Egypt in 48 BC (he came in the middle of complicated Roman politics, seeking to kill Pompey), Cleopatra was 21 years old, and was in exile as part of the royal struggles for the throne. She raised an army on her own and snuck back into the palace in Alexandria. This is when she met Caesar, who was in his mid-50s, for the first time. The initial meeting between Cleopatra and Caesar has been speculated upon to varying degrees of exaggeration and embellishment by historians and writers across the centuries. Cleopatra is mainly remembered for manipulating and seducing Caesar and casting him under her spell. However, it is important to keep in mind that this was most probably Cleopatra’s first sexual encounter, whereas Caesar, the seasoned seducer, was past his prime and had engaged in an impressively long list of love affairs. </p>
<p>Regardless of the degree of seduction (and the initiator of the seduction) that occurred at this initial meeting, Cleopatra and Caesar joined forces. Caesar stayed in Egypt for several months, and during some point an affair undeniably began between the two of them. Less than a year later, Cleopatra was pregnant. Soon she gave birth to her first son Caesarion (“little Caesar”). The birth of Caesarion was a big deal because Caesar had not had any heirs in the three other marriages he had been in. Cleopatra giving birth to Caesar’s son was also a strategic move for her own political gain. She used her new motherhood to her political advantage and used Caesarion’s birth to strengthen her identification with the Egyptian goddess of fertility, Isis. She began to embody qualities of Isis, assuming the divinity of the goddess into her own self, even wearing the costume of Isis during ceremonial events. Furthermore, she now had a legitimate heir for the throne and a way to continue her line – something not even Alexander the Great had been able to do. </p>
<p>After the birth of Caesarion, Cleopatra solidified her power at home. She was a capable ruler, and records speak of the many roles she embodied as the leader of Egypt. She managed her internal affairs well, stifling conspiracies from antagonistic family members, handling petitions from the people, and heading both the secular and religious bureaucracies. Her reign was especially notable by the lack of revolts in Upper Egypt (which there had been a lot of in the century and a half preceding her rule). She encouraged scholarship and revived intellectual studies in Alexandria.
After ensuring that her affairs at home were under control, she left Egypt for the first time to embark on a large trip of over 2000 miles by ship to Rome. Cleopatra brought Caesarion with her, legitimizing her visit as one of orchestrating a meeting between Caesar and his new son. Cleopatra played an interesting role in Rome. While she was a queen at home, she was an outsider in Rome, where she was perceived as a mere courtesan. Women held fewer rights in Rome than in Egypt, and Cleopatra defied many gender norms – she was smart and capable, she was economically independent, and she was richer than any man in Rome. Many leading politicians at the time, such as Plutarch and Cicero, had many not-very-nice things to say about her.</p>
<p>Cleopatra was in Rome in 44 BC during the Ides of March, when Caesar was brutally murdered. In the chaos that ensued, many blamed Cleopatra for assuming a role in the murder: for conspiring, for causing blinding passion in Caesar, for imperial design. There is no evidence of any of these claims, but regardless, Rome was not a safe place for her, and so she returned to Alexandria and slipped almost seamlessly back into her role as mother-goddess and queen. </p>
<p>During this time, there was a lot of politics going on in Rome. After Caesar’s murder there was a power vacuum, and it became apparent that Mark Antony and Octavian would be the key players after defeating Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi. Cleopatra decided to get involved in this mess of Roman politics, and sailed to Tarsus to meet Mark Antony. In the midst of her sensational, sensual, extravagant entrance, one characterized by “a blinding explosion of color, sound, and smell,” Cleopatra and Mark Antony met for the first time for dinner where Cleopatra showed off her extreme wealth. They met several more times over the course of the few weeks that Cleopatra stayed in Tarsus, and eventually, Mark Antony fell head over heels for her. </p>
<p>Mark Antony came back to Egypt with Cleopatra. Cleopatra was a very busy woman. Not only was she busy throwing very extravagant parties and entertaining Mark Antony and visitors, she was also dealing with official business of the kingdom by receiving petitions and envoys, presiding over festivals, participating in religious rites, meeting with advisors, supervising economic discussions, and meting out justice. Did she have time to sleep or play with her kids or just relax?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Octavian lusted after Cleopatra’s Egypt and the wealth it would bring to Rome. He claimed that Cleopatra had seduced Mark Antony as part of her plot to make Rome a province of Egypt. Octavian used rhetoric to convince Rome that Cleopatra was an evil woman who ruined men on her quest to conquer Rome and was consequently a threat to Rome’s security, and declared war on Cleopatra. </p>
<p>In response, Cleopatra began to gather her army. Her fluency with languages was especially notable here, when she was able to communicate not only with the various ethnic groups in her troops, which included Armenian, Ethiopian, and Median, but also with the Eastern dignitaries and Hellenistic sovereigns. Cleopatra was at the head of the battle preparations and was also Egypt’s commander in chief. Could this woman not take on any more roles? </p>
<p>The conflict that ensued between Octavian and Cleopatra/Mark Antony was chaotic at the Battle of Actium. Mark Antony opted for a naval campaign that failed miserably, and he suffered a huge defeat to Octavian. Cleopatra orchestrated a strategic retreat (it was “spirited, disciplined, resourceful”) to her palace and waited for Octavian to come to her. </p>
<p>Octavian arrived in Alexandria, and through a series of miscommunications between Cleopatra and Mark Antony not unlike the death scene in Romeo and Juliet, Mark Antony killed himself upon hearing the incorrect news of Cleopatra’s death. Cleopatra found out when it was too late, and Mark Antony died in her arms. Cleopatra was captured by Octavian, and this was the first and only time she met him face to face. After, she locked herself in her mausoleum and committed suicide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She would [have] brilliantly ornament[ed] his triumph” (301)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her death is as speculated upon as that of Alexander the Great. There are rumors that she killed herself with an asp, the symbol of Egypt, but it is more likely that Cleopatra, known for her crisp decision making and meticulous planning, used poison rather than place the fate of her life on the whims of a wild animal. </p>
<p>Her history started to be rewritten almost immediately after her death. Octavian, the victor, had the privilege of writing history with his own voice, and he chose the imagery that fitted his story the best. And Octavian, who was basically outwitted by a woman (he had tried his hardest to keep Cleopatra alive as a symbol of his victory), made sure to distort Cleopatra’s tremendous courage and cleverness in outwitting him. </p>
<p>Cleopatra showed tremendous courage in her suicide. Her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty (all her children were killed off). She died at age 39, having ruled 22 years.</p></div></div></main><footer style="text-align:center;margin:5rem auto 1.45rem auto;font-size:0.6rem">© <!-- -->2020<!-- --> Yennie Jun</footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script>
