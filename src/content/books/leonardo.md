Leonardo Da Vinci was a man that I really can feel inspired by. Leonardo was a man who had a curiosity of learning (that transcended his art) until he died; he was always trying to understand the world he lived in (and all of its mysteries). He kept his scientific discoveries, explorations, and observations in his thousands of Notebooks, which he kept hidden while he was alive and the majority of which were not understood in their entirety until many hundreds of years after his death. In them, Capra argues that Leonardo's science was brilliant and systemic, compared to the more mechanical view of science espoused by Descartes, Newton, and Galileo. Capra argues that Leonardo was in fact the first "systemic thinker," viewing the world as holistic rather than as divided into modular and separate pieces. He found connections and patterns in the many different fields he studied (geometry, optics, mechanics, light, wave patterns) which aided his learning and led him to the conclusion that everything in nature is connected.

>"He always looked for patterns that would interconnect observations from different disciplines; his mind seemed to work best when it was occupied with multiple projects" (86)


I found Leonardo's love of learning inspiring. He never had a Classical training and so he spent most of his adult life teaching himself geometry and Latin (which he started learning at age 40!) and anatomy and so many other fields. (This actually reminded me of Abraham Lincoln, another self-taught genius who never had the opportunity to engage in a rigorous Classical education in his childhood).

One of the funniest anecdotes was when Leonardo was asked to build a giant bronze statue of a horse (3x the size of a normal horse) for the Duke of Milan. Leonardo spent so long planning and doing his research (including a full treatise on horse anatomy, and methods to improve the sewage system for the horse stables) that by the time he was ready to build the horse, the project ran out of money because Milan got into war and the Duke used the bronze that would be used for the horse on cannonballs!

I think for Leonardo, his main goal in life was lifelong learning rather than the "final products." Capra argues similarly, that for Leonardo, the final product of the art was never the end goal ... the process was what mattered most for him.

>"In his art as in his science, he always seemed to be more interested in the process of exploration than in the completed work or final results. Thus many of his paintings and all of his science remained unfinished work in progress." (165)


In general, I thought the arguments made by Capra about Leonardo's life were really interesting, trying to take a holistic approach to viewing Leonardo as an artist and scientist. However, I found the second half of the book ("Leonardo the Scientist") felt more like a list of his accomplishments and notes and dragged on a bit near the end.
